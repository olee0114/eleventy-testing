    <h4 class="textbox" style="max-width: 1000px">The Heart of Puerto Rico is a 13-episode virtual reality documentary series focusing on artists in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. To make the film, directors Peter Decherney (University of Pennsylvania) and Jean Lee (writer/director) collaborated with a wide range of artists in Puerto Rico, from internationally-known sculptors and painters to street clowns and drag performers.
<p>Each episode takes viewers deep into the artists’ creative processes as you explore their work. The series amplifies stories of science fiction painter Jose Luis Vargas, for example. It puts you in the middle of the surrealist puppeteers Poncili Creacion’s studio. It takes you to the town of Orocovis to see a new national myth being created for the first time by the theater group Y No Había Luz. It takes you backstage with drag performer Anoma Lía. And you march though the city of Mayaguez with the Vueltabajo circus troupe, among other episodes. Along the way, Puerto Rico’s creative community explores themes of colonization, Caribbean identity, and the power of art. Virtual reality documentary is not only more immersive than traditional (flat) films, it can create a greater connection to its subjects and pack an emotional punch.</p>
<p>Peter and Jean have been working in virtual reality documentary since 2016. The Heart of Puerto Rico has been shown at film festivals across the U.S. and won awards for directing and best documentary experience at the 2019 AT&amp;T awards.</h4></p>
